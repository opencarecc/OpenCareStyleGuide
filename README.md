# opencare Style Guide
Hello, here is where you find all the info to work with http://opencare.cc related visuals and communication assets.

- The Style Guide is an interactive PDF file. By clicking on the visual elements (logo, banner etc...) you will be prompted to the original asset in the repository.

- The Assets folder contains all the files used to create both physical and digital flyers, banners etc in various formats: .png (with transparent background), .svg (for vector graphics)
  - the file naming convention works in this way: OC-file_description-version-destination.png/svg See details below about each and any part of the file naming convention, and please keep it consistent when creating new assets
    - *OC* stands for OpenCare
    - *file_description* should be brief and please use underscore in place of spaces (snake case)
    - *version* is optional and can track different versions or translations of a file
    - *destination* is usually "print" (300 dpi) or "web" (72 dpi)

- Included icons are part of a larger collection called Material Design (https://design.google.com/icons/) released under the [Creative Common Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)


Enjoy!
